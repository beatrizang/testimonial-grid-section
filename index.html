                "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been Looking to make a
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course.
                I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR starup."

          <h1>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>
          <p class="paragraph-white">
            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.
            I needed some structure form professonals who can help me learn programming
            step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs
            who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
            and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait
            long for assitance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
            It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
            In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
            receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
